Oh, please don't let me die
Waiting for your touch

No, don't give up on life - This endless dead end

My hourglass is cracked
And it's my life
Spilling out, blowing over like sand
Just like the feelings I have grown to love...
How quickly they can all fade away
Is it too late to say...
(I wish I was there)

Oh, please don't let me die
Waiting for your touch

I'll never - Not ever
Feel what it's like to lose you
Never again - So please forget everything and...
Restart

No, don't give up on life
This endless dead end

And just this - I will wish
All of your pain and sadness
Fades someday...
I hope to brush it away
For now, I'll see you off

My time is spinning around
Your deep black eyes
I have forgotten the time
And now our memories are gone

There lies a sweet nostalgic scent
A trap - Hidden by all of my memories
They call to seize, they're beckoning
And yet
I cannot find the strength to resist
Without a fight I drown
(I wish you were here)

Oh never close your eyes
Searching for a true fate

Endlessly, pursuing
Warmth that quickly vanished
It fades away - Without a trace
Beginning and... restart

So let us try again
From the very first time

Please trust me, cause surely
Each and every moment
In this loop, is leading me back to you
So I'll see you again
Fading in
Fading out
Fading in
Fading out

(I wish we were there)

If you could turn back time
To relive those days

You'd cower - That power
Is cold and sad and tragic
Even so I will not stand by
I'll rise again - Restart

No, don't give up on life
This endless dead end

Do you lack - Do you have
The strength that many don't to
Not look back
But can you promise me that
For now I'll see you off...

And we'll die waiting for a new day
Once again
And we'll start waiting for a new day
Me and you

Oh please don't let me die
Please don't fade away
